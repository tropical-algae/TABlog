- I actually launched another blog a while back <br>where I used to share tech tutorials <br>and jot down notes on various tools I worked with. <br>Unfortunately, <br>it hasn’t seen an update in a long time <br>I just haven’t had the time or energy to keep it going.
- That’s why I decided to start something simpler <br>and more lightweight—this site! <br>Here, I’ll mostly be documenting my research journey <br>(yep, it’s going to be mostly academic stuff), <br>but if you’re curious about my earlier posts, <br>feel free to check out my original blog.
- If you’d like to get in touch, <br>here’s how you can reach me:
